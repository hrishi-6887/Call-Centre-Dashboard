### Welcome to the Call Center Dashboard project! This dashboard is built using **Microsoft Excel**, **Pivot Tables**, and **various chart types** to analyze and visualize call center performance using a dataset of 1000 customer calls.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive visualization of call center data including:

- Total calls, revenue, and duration
- Monthly and weekly call trends
- Ratings breakdown and happy callers
- Gender-based caller distribution
- City-wise purchase amount distribution

All insights are derived from a structured dataset containing:
